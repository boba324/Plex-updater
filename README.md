# Plex Updater shell script

Hey lads this script does only what the name of the script says it does. 
It fetches whichever version is available on plex.tv and installs it. 

Lines 42/43 can be uncommented/commented however you like to either clear files
directly after their installation or to have them move to a finished directory to 
check if the version on plex.tv is already installed. 

I don't really intent to adjust the script much since it does what it should
but feel free to let me know if you have found issues or errors.
